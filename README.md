For the first program I made the queue classs then initalized an empty list to store the items in the queue
Then I did the enqueue to add an item to the end of the queue
Then I did the dequeue to remove and return the item from the queue if it's not empty
Then I made a function to return True if the queue is empty, otherwise False
Then the function to check if the parenthesis are balanced then made the test cases

For the second program I repeated steps 1-4 then made a function to simulate the print job 
Within that function I created a new queue instance, enqueued all print jobs, processed the jobs in the order they were written, and dequeued the next job and simulated processing
Then I listed all the jobs and had them print sucessfully
